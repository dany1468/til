  - 以下のプレイヤー退出とゲームのシャットダウンの待機は使えそう

```
game.Players.PlayerRemoving:Connect(function(player)
    save(player)
    LoadedPlayers[player] = nil -- Remove the player from the table, this is done outside of the save function as this should only be done when the player is leaving
end)

--Now this is where we finally make the game wait for data saving to finish before shutting off
game:BindToClose(function() --This function will only run once the game begins shutting down, :BindToClose() can stop the game from shutting down until your code has finished executing, however, if it takes longer than 30 seconds, it will shut down anyway, fortunately data saving will hardly take 3 seconds
    while next(LoadedPlayers) ~= nil do
        task.wait() -- Keep waiting until the LoadedPlayers data is empty, which will only be empty once all data saving operations have completed, the loop will automatically break once this happens and the game can finally shut down
    end
end)
```
